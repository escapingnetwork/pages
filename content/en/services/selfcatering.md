We are pleased to offer you a self-catering accommodation experience.
This option provides you with the flexibility and freedom to tailor your
meals according to your preferences and schedule, allowing you to make
the most of your stay.

**Facilities:** Our self-catering hosts are equipped with a fully functional kitchen,
complete with modern appliances and utensils, enabling you to prepare
and enjoy your own meals.

**Grocery Shopping:** To make your self-catering experience seamless, there are local grocery
stores and markets conveniently located nearby. You can explore these
options to stock up on your favorite ingredients, snacks, and beverages.
Feel free to immerse yourself in the local culinary scene by trying
fresh, local produce and specialties.

**Meal Planning:** Self-catering allows you the freedom to plan your meals according to your own schedule. Whether you prefer a leisurely breakfast in the
morning or a late-night snack, the kitchen is at your disposal. You can
experiment with local recipes or stick to familiar favorites---whatever
suits your taste.

**Local Dining Recommendations:** While you have the option to self-cater, we also understand the allure of exploring local restaurants and eateries. Feel free to ask your host for recommendations, and they will be happy to share their favorite
spots in the area.

We hope the self-catering option adds a personal touch to your stay,
providing you with the flexibility to create your own unique experience.
If you have any questions or require assistance during your stay, please
don't hesitate to reach out.
