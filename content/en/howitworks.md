# How It Works

Finding the right place to stay while studying in Ireland should be exciting, not stressful. At Capybara House, we’ve made the process simple and supportive, guiding you every step of the way. Here’s how it works:

## 1. Submit Your Request
It all starts with you! Fill out our Request Accommodation Form, letting us know where you’ll be studying (like which university or college) and how long you plan to stay. This helps us find the perfect spot tailored to your needs.

## 2. We Review and Reach Out
Once we receive your form, our team carefully reviews it to ensure we’ve got all the details right. We’ll then get in touch to confirm everything and guide you through the payment process, which needs to be completed 4 weeks before your arrival date to secure your spot.

## 3. You Make the Payment
With everything set, you’ll complete the payment securely and easily. This step locks in your reservation and lets us move forward with finding your ideal home.

## 4. We Match You with a Host
Behind the scenes, we work with our trusted hosts to check availability and find a great match for you. We take this seriously to ensure your new place feels just right.

## 5. Welcome to Your New Home
Once everything’s confirmed, we’ll let you know all the exciting details—who your host is, where you’ll be staying, and how to get settled. We’re here to assist you every step of the way until you’re happily at home.

At Capybara House, we understand that life doesn’t always follow a straight path. Whether you have a unique situation or an urgent need, we’re always open to considering special cases or emergencies—just reach out, and we’ll do our best to help!
